        Thorin and Company were a group of thirteen Dwarves, the Wizard Gandalf, and the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, led by
        Thorin II Oakenshield in TA 2941. Their purpose was to regain the lost Dwarven kingdom of the Lonely Mountain
        from the dragon Smaug.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
                youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA
                2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he
                participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath
                the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch
                found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even
                in death.[2]

                Thorin became King-in-Exile of Durin's Folk in TA 2850 after his father went missing, and died in the
                dungeons of Dol Guldur.
